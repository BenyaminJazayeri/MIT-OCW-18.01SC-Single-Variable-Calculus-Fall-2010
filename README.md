My coursework for MIT OCW 18.01SC Single Variable Calculus Fall 2010 class. This covers the exact same coursework required of MIT students present at class for full marks.

All solutions are my own.

Because the Scholar (SC) version of the course was taken, the coursework is organized into Sessions, Problem Sets and Exams. Each includes the problem statements alongside my handwritten solutions.

Taught by [Prof. David Jerison](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=Prof.+David+Jerison) and Recitation Instructors Christine Breiner, David Jordan and Joel Lewis.
